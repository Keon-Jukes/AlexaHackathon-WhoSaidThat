# Who Said That
My code for Amazon Alexa's "Aging &amp; Engaging: Hackathon 2022

## Milestones
Configuring APLA with a ternary operator to either play a success sound or an error sound
storing quotes persistently to constantly deliver a fresh new batch of quotes to the end user
Figuring out how to adjust context with "setQuestion" & "setQuestionType" functions to make one central guessAuthor handler which can take care of a warm up question, round one question, or even the new presidential round opposed to many separate question handlers.
## Concepts
APLA, 
Alexa APIs,
Persistence,
AWS S3 Bucket
